## Usage in Radionuclide Planner

The ICRP 107 data is used as an **extended database** for nuclides not included in the primary curated database (`data/nuclides.json`, ~34 nuclides from Cornejo et al.).

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Parser** (`tools/parse-icrp107.js`) — Reads NDX/RAD files and generates `data/icrp107-index.json` plus `data/icrp107-data.js`
   - Converts half-lives to seconds
   - Extracts photon emissions (G, X rays, and annihilation quanta; excludes beta, alpha, electrons)
   - Applies Cornejo filter: E ≥ 20 keV, yield ≥ 0.01%
   - Result: nuclides with at least one photon meeting criteria

2. **Browser Loader** (`js/icrp107-loader.js`) — Loads the embedded JS data when available, with JSON `fetch()` fallback
   - Provides search by ID or name
   - Normalizes names ("Lu177" ↔ "Lu-177", "177Lu" ↔ "Lu-177")
   - Calculates gamma dose constants on-demand using `PHYSICS.calcGammaConstants()`

3. **Properties Page** (`index.html`) — Extended search with on-demand dose calculation
   - Main search first queries `data/nuclides.json` (34 curated nuclides)
   - If no match found, shows "Search in ICRP 107" button
   - When ICRP 107 result is selected:
     - Displays half-life, decay modes, photon spectrum (filtered)
     - **Automatically calculates** Γ^H*(10) and Γ^H'(0.07) from photon emissions
    - Shows warning: constants calculated from ICRP 107 emissions are not manually validated
    - Photons table shows energy (keV), yield (%), and type (G/X/AQ)

## Gamma Dose Constants

ICRP 107 photons are fed into the **Cornejo et al. (2006)** calculation:

$$\Gamma^{H*(10)} = K \sum_i n_i \cdot h(E_i)$$

where:
- $K$ = 28.648 μSv·h⁻¹·GBq⁻¹·m² per pSv·cm²
- $n_i$ = photon yield (fraction per decay)
- $h(E_i)$ = ICRU 57 / ICRP 74 fluence-to-dose conversion coefficient

Constants calculated from ICRP 107 are **informational only**. They are NOT manually validated and should not be used for clinical or regulatory submissions without independent verification.

### Validation Against Published Values

A validation tool (`validate-icrp107.html`) is included to compare constants calculated from ICRP 107 photons against published values from Cornejo et al. (2006) for key nuclides:

- **F-18** — Published: 166 μSv·h⁻¹·GBq⁻¹·m² (Good agreement expected)
- **Tc-99m** — Published: 21.7 μSv·h⁻¹·GBq⁻¹·m² (Good agreement expected)
- **I-131** — Published: 65.7 μSv·h⁻¹·GBq⁻¹·m² (Good agreement expected)
- **Lu-177** — Published: 6.0 μSv·h⁻¹·GBq⁻¹·m² (Good agreement expected)
- **Ga-68** — Published: 157 μSv·h⁻¹·GBq⁻¹·m² (**Special case**: β⁺ emitter)

Access at `validate-icrp107.html` to run the comparison. Deviations < 5% indicate good agreement; 5–15% suggest acceptable approximation; > 15% warrant investigation.

#### Positron Emitters

Beta-plus emitters include positron annihilation quanta when present in `ICRP-07.RAD` (type code `3`, label `AQ`). This is required for PET nuclides such as F-18 and Ga-68, where the 511 keV photons dominate the external dose-rate constant.

## Data Quality Notes

- **Half-lives**: Extracted from NDX format descriptor; converted to seconds with full scientific notation support (picoseconds to millions of years)
- **Photon energies**: In keV; 1 decimal place precision
- **Yields**: Percent per decay; 4 decimal place precision
- **Decay modes**: Limited; NDX parsing captures daughters and branching fractions where available
- **Beta spectra**: Available in BET file (111K lines); NOT parsed in phase 1
- **Calculators**: `decay.html` and `dose.html` currently use the curated main database only; ICRP 107 entries are reference/search results on the Properties page.
